# Contrast_MRI_GENE
This repo is for a multimodal framework that fuses T1 and T2 MRI modalities to extract rich, integrated representations of brain structure. By leveraging the hidden features learned from this fused representation, you could perform downstream analysis to discover novel genes associated with brain structure, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of genotypeâ€“phenotype relationships in the brain.

The primary data resources is UKBiobank

There two attempts to merge the modality
- one is by cross-attention
- one is by contrast learning
